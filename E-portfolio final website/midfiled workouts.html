            <strong>Excercises</strong>
            <br>
            The midfield position requires a balance of skills and strengths. Since they play in the middle of the pitch they require a bit of everything. They must have speed, agility, strength and power. 
            <br><br>
            Running and Turning<br>
            Run diagonally then make a turn to the left side and then the right side.
<br><br>
Lunge maps <br>
Lunge forward with your right leg then lunge sideways with your right leg. Then lunge back with your left leg and sideways with your left leg. 
<br><br>
Lateral jumps 
 <br>
 Jump as far as you can sideways and keep your other leg in the air while doing the same. <br><br>

 Split Squat <br>
 Use a bench to keep your foot back. Then lower your body. Your knee should be bent when you lower your body. <br><br>

 Box step ups <br>
 Place one leg on top of a box. Then drive through with the opposite leg upwards. <br><br>

<strong>Workouts/Training</strong><br>
This is an excellent video for you if you are a midfielder since it focuses on multiple aspects which will help you to a great extent on the football pitch. Those skills/aspects are 
ball control/mastery, agility, speed and first touch. This is also a great training drill if you are an individual and if you do not have anyone to train with.
