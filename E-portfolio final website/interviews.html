                    <strong>Sparsh Malhotra, 15 years</strong>
    
                    <p>How did you get into playing the sport? <br>
                        I got into playing the sport by my brother and one of my neighbours. Both of them being best friends loved to play football and just encouraged me to start playing and the rest is history.
                    
                    <br><br>
                        How did you make it semi-professionally/professionally?
                    
                        Being a professional footballer in India is very difficult, football as a sport is not spoken about enough. it is simply not paid enough attention to. Football is the worlds most famous game and should be credited more especially in the country that I live in. However, as I grew up I did a bit of research on how to make it pro, as I was an aspiring footballer. One thing that was common mostly everywhere was this tournament called I league. In order to be a professional in India, you have to join one of the AIFF approved football teams so that's exactly what I did. I tried out for a team called youth champions league, in my first season I started as a striker for them in MDFA (District level). Then later I changed teams to pifa one of the most credited and famous teams in India(Ranked at number one currently). I got my aiff badge and played junior Ileague. In order to make it professional , I worked a lot outside training. I ate the right things, worked on technical aspects of the game and even studied plays this allowed me to gain an edge over everyone else.
    
                        <br><br>
    
                    What do you think is required to make it pro as a footballer?
    <br>
    
                    Winning mentality is something that I think every footballer should have, they should have the desire to win and not being able to accept anything with a win. This shall allow them to give their 100%
    
    Dedication- If you want to become a professional footballer, you have to dedicate your whole life to the game. You have to be doing more than the others and be working day in and day out.
    
    Consistency- Being consistent is something not everyone is good at but it is something that is very important you have to be consistent every day even when your mind is saying no you have to be consistent
    
    Discipline- The most important point out of all discipline is very important, you have to treat the game very well, listen to your coaches, take criticism in a positive way, show up early for training, etc. Being disciplined with you're nutrition you have to be healthy in order to become a pro.

    <br>
    Are nutrition and workouts imortant? <br>
    Yes 
    
    <br><br>
    What do you recommend other young footballers do to make it as a pro?
    <br>
    Do what your heart tells you to
    Give all that you got
    Watch and study professional games
    Make sure to keep yourself fit even during offseason
    Work on and off the pitch
    Be consistent

                    <p>
                        How did you get into playing the sport? <br>
                        As a child, I was diagnosed with ADHD, I was never Able to do well in school. I turned to sports and a very early age. Eventually my passion for running turned into a passion for football for me.
                        <br> <br>
                        How did you make it semi-professionally/professionally?<br>
                        I was always first team level, I finally found a team and coach who were having a similar tactical mentality to mine.I alwasy knew that I played well but my team coudl not support me. Therefore I found a club with a coach who has a similar mentality to mine and understand my playing style. He knew my capabilities therefore helped me become a better player in his U16 I-league team.  
                        <br><br>
                        What do you think is required to make it pro as a footballer? <br>
                        It might sound cliche but what's required it 'hunger.' Through all my experiences, the ones taht make it to the top only think football. They make this their goal and work everyday because they can clearly see what's on the other side of their efforts. When they are on the pitch, they give it everything they have, the succeed.
                        <br><br>
    
                        Is nurition and working out important? <br>
                        Yes
                        <br><br>
                        What do you recommend other young footballers do to make it as a pro?<br>
                        I believe understating the nutrition and the workouts is a big stage as a youngster and that starts to give an edge to children.

 Bhaichung Bhutia Football Academy- Technical Lead & head Coach

                            <br> <br>
                            What do you look for in young football players or when scouting?
<br>
When I am looking at young players or when I am scouting young players I look at the fundamentals of the sport. This includes positioning, passing, dribbling, shooting the basic. at this stage if thy have the basics mastered then they can go on to become much better players. I also look at their effort. If a player is not putting in enough effort then he is not worthy enough to be in your team. On the field players should put in the most effort and that show if they are willing to improve or not.

                            <br><br>
                            How do you think young footballers can improve?
<br>
I think that young footballers can improve if they just put in the effort. At this age they are not too far behind from other player who are better than them. Of course they have to focus on their nutrition and technical skill. At this age I would just recommend playing the sport and having fun. There is nothing better than that. If you want to make it pro then you are going to have to put more time and effort in training.

                            <br><br>
        
                            Is nutrition and workouts important at this stage?
                            <br>
                            Towards the later half of this age group nutrition and workouts are important. If you want to become a better player then you need to focus on these two aspects because theyt will help develop your body and gain a competitive edge in matches.
